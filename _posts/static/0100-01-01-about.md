[2x2-2.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2x2-2.jpg) Bob works with Bancom II in a Poverty Eradication Tandem with Roxas Kalaw Foundation. A non-writer who writes, he is inspired by writers with prophetic voices: Robert Heinlein, science fictionist who wrote Stranger In A Strange Land; Joey Ayala, prophetic minstrel who wrote Lahat Ng Bagay Ay Magkaugnay and 16 Love Songs; Dr. Wayne Dyer who wrote about Quantum Thinking as “the way you look at things changes the things you look at”; Dr. Sixto Roxas, who in 30 years or so wrote ECSOM (Ecosystem, Community, Sustainable, Organization, Management), a framework designed to eradicate poverty in building Self Reliant Communities;Ernie Abella, plainly prophetic (ernieabella.org); YAHWEH, who wrote Genesis, Revelation and all the books in between; and last but not the least, the Pilipino Masa, MAY THEY NOT WAIT AND SEE, BUT BELIEVE AND MOVE TO SEE THE CHANGES COMING AND THEY WILL KEEP THE CHANGE.!
